  \opening{To whom it may concern,}

  I would be very interested in a position as a game developer.
  I graduated from Emory University in Atlanta this May where I
  studied Comparative Literature, Computer Science and Linguistics.
  I have practical programming experience from a few different jobs,
  as well as research experience in the Natural Language Processing
  field.
  A position as a game developer could be a good way to exercise both
  my artistic and programming interests.

  My enjoyment of writing, playing instruments and programming seem to
  converge together at game development.
  Games seem to be one of the most prominent areas in which art and
  technology meet.
  Game development also coincides with some of my programming
  interests, which are mainly focused on Artificial Intelligence and
  Natural Language Processing.
  My interest in Artificial Intelligence was spurred by my research
  in NLP and a college course on the subject.
  The importance of AI to game development is rather evident,
  and I would imagine that, depending on the project,
  there might be opportunities for NLP to be used in game development
  as well.
  I think game development could be a good use of my various interests
  and talents.

  \closing{Thank you for your consideration,}
