\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

After four years as a software engineer, I feel myself searching
for work more meaningful than what can I can find in the programming
industry.
As I leave my current programming position and begin thinking
about my next job, I can't help but recall that many of the
days I have looked most forward to over the past few years have been
days I was scheduled to teach a ceramics class, volunteer as a
Math tutor, or lecture my coworkers in informal programming classes.
My goal is to turn what have so far been my most enriching after-work
activities into my vocation.

Although I don't have formal education experience, I believe that my
time spent planning months of future software development can help
inform curriculum planning, the give and take as we find a common
basis for discussion with a single student I've tutored can inform how
I perform that same conversation with a classroom, and tools I use to
understand why a ceramics student is struggling to center a piece of
clay can inform how I design a lesson plan exercising the most
difficult aspects of the material.
I have gained teaching experience as a mentor for a young programmer
at work, as a volunteer, and as a ceramics instructor, and I hope to
continue learning to be a better educator as I place myself on a
pedagogical career path.

I am excited to turn what has previously been a constant hobby into my
vocation, and look forward to a more rewarding career in education.
I appreciate the chance to speak with you as I begin to make this
transition.

\closing{Thank you for the opportunity,}
