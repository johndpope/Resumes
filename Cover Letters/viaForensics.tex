\opening{To Whom It May Concern,}

I would be very excited to lend my programming skills towards creating
a more secure world.  It would make me proud to write software which
improves users' privacy and security in the mobile world.  With five
years of professional experience writing Python, I believe I could
help viaForensics empower its users to access their mobile devices
more safely.

Designing and building quality software is something I am passionate
about.  A look through my open source work on GitHub for Freedom
Games' PlanetLab reveals a well-documented code base with 99 percent
unit test coverage.  I am a strong believer in test driven
development, readable code and good documentation.  I also enjoy
playing a role in architectural direction.  I have designed and built
systems for large-scale aggregation of news headlines and deployed
public-facing web applications, and I always welcome the opportunity
to work on more architectural problems.

I would be very happy to speak with you more about how I might apply
my background writing Python and architecting systems to improve
mobile security and privacy.

\closing{Thank you for the opportunity,}
